## What is Developer DAO

The project was started as an experiment by [Nader Dabit](twitter.com/dabit3) to
see what can be achieved when we bring together talented and like-minded people
who are interested in learning about and building on Web3.

The DAO operates inside our discord server and have over 930+ active users. To
gain access to this server you need to own a Devs for Revolution NFT. The
contract for purchasing one can be found on etherscan.io. Over 3,300+ NFT had
been minted. Our community is composed of developers from different backgrounds,
and we even have had members including core team members from Dev.to, Chakra-UI,
React, The Graph, and more.

Initial deployment of Developer DAO NFT:

We have 2 main projects we are working on:

## Developer DAO website:

https://github.com/Developer-DAO/developer-dao

This is the public Developer DAO site repo. At the moment it allows members to
view their genesis NFT by entering in its ID. As the community takes shape we
will decide what this website becomes and build it as a collective.

There are over 25 active developers working on sites and shipping features
everyday

## Derivative:

https://github.com/Developer-DAO/pixel-avatars

Derivatives of the Developer DAO genesis NFTs; similar to how Loot has its own
derivatives projects

## With your support, we hope to accomplish the following:

- Server cost for Discourse. Lots of DAO is organized discussion around
  proposals by using Discourse

- Gas fee for the derivative project smart contract deployment. Gas fees are
  expensive and we need funding in order to deploy the contract

- Produce educational material to onboard more web2 users and help them
  transition to web3

- Bounties to reward content creators who have produced educational content &
  developers who have worked on features

- Build the largest community where developers can learn more about web3
  - create a roadmap for devs to get into web3
